# Setup
- To see the examples, run a local web server. The easiest is with Python.
  - `python3 -m http.server`
  - `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
  - The pages are now viewable at `http://localhost:8000`

# Note:
- All of the convert.py scripts in each folder should be run using python version 3.
